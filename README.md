Project Guidelines


1. Group Formation

approval from the lecturer is required.

2. Project Guidelines


a) Project Overview:


? Each group will develop a comprehensive business plan for a unique Learning and

Development Centre or Skill Development Centre in Hong Kong. The centre will focus

on teaching specific skills and fostering personal growth or wellness, with an emphasis on

integrating cutting-edge technology and holistic approaches.

? The business plan should include progressive lessons that learners can advance through,

ensuring a structured and continuous learning experience.

? The plan should incorporate innovative solutions that cater to the modern needs of

learners, ensuring the business model is competitive and relevant to current trends and

demands in Hong Kong's dynamic environment.

? It is essential to ensure that the business plan is practical and feasible within the context

of Hong Kong's market.

? The centre will operate as a subsidiary of a Hong Kong-based corporation that is registered

in Hong Kong, conducts local business operations, and is listed on the main board of the

Hong Kong Stock Exchange, showcasing its strong local business presence.

? The selection of the Hong Kong-listed corporation for this venture must be approved by

the lecturer. It is essential that the centre aligns with the corporation's strategic objectives

and offers potential benefits to the corporation.

? The centre is scheduled to launch on 1 October 2025, operating under standard business

conditions.

and HK$10 million, fully funded by the chosen Hong Kong-based corporation.


c) Project Management and Communication:

 Each group member will rate the contributions of other group members. If a member

receives a poor rating, their mark for the assessed assignment will be deducted

accordingly. It is important for all students to contribute fairly to the project.


5. Resolution of Conflicts within the Group


A group is formed by individuals working together towards a common goal. However,

differences in communication and working styles among group members may lead to conflicts

that can impede progress.


When conflicts arise, students should:

 address problems as they arise instead of ignoring them;

 discuss any issues in the presence of all group members;

 avoid blaming each other for past failures and instead focus on identifying necessary changes;

 strive to reach a mutual understanding that all group members agree upon.

Each group has one opportunity to remove a non-contributing member after the submission of

the Environmental Analysis Report, using the peer evaluation system. Each member can submit

the Environmental Analysis Peer Evaluation Form, along with valid supporting documents such

as the Minutes of Group Meeting and group conversation records, to demonstrate that the

concerned member has not made any contribution to the group project. The deadline for

submitting these documents is 23 February 2025 at 23:59 HKT. The lecturer will make the final

decision on whether the concerned member will be allowed to continue working in the group or

will be asked to work on the remaining parts of the project alone. This decision will be

communicated on or before 1 March 2025. It is important to note that no group member can

CCBS4020 Integrated Project Project Guidelines

be removed after 1 March 2025. For any subsequent issues with group members, the peer

evaluation system can be used to report non-contributing members.

If conflicts persist or further assistance is needed, students should seek help and advice from their

supervisor.

6. Attitude of the Group

Each group is responsible for taking the initiative to seek advice from the supervisor and keeping

the supervisor informed of their progress. It is important to actively engage with the supervisor

and maintain open lines of communication throughout the project.

Please note that the project supervisor may provide feedback, both positive and negative, on your

work. Embrace this feedback as an opportunity for growth and improvement.

different business functions, and limited ability to develop a business plan.

There is limited evidence of analytical thinking as well as the presentation is

not well-structured and organised.

F Show no or little knowledge of the key concepts and theories in different

business functions, and lack of ability in developing a business plan. The
